In the Nigerian city of Lagos, an explosion at a warehouse has sparked a massive fire. It's been reported that the blaze quickly spread to other buildings in a densely populated market district. Jon Gambrell, who's the chief correspondent for the Associated Press news agency in the city, described what he'd seen and what he'd heard. Earlier this morning at about 9 o'clock, I was still inside my own flat in Lagos when a massive explosion was heard. It rattled my windows a few miles away from where the blast happened. across much of this country tonight, a massive winter storm and already, the ripple effect for travel being felt coast to coast. The monster storm system stretching from Indiana to Maine, all the way down to North Carolina. More than a dozen states (under winter watches and warnings) this evening. And this is moving fast. Nearly a foot of snow in some states already. More than a foot of snow in forecast for Syracuse, New York, and in the heartland tonight, the threat of more twisters. Close to three dozen reported tornadoes on Christmas. This evening, they're bracing for more bad weather. Our extreme weather team is across the storm zone tonight. You can see Sam Champion there. He has the latest track in just a moment. But we're going to begin with ABC's Alex Perez in Indianapolis. Strong winds whipped around fast-falling snow in Indianapolis and made getting around by foot or car nearly impossible. David Mathis struggled just to keep up with the shoveling. You saw no snow and then within a couple of hours, what did you see? Yeah, just basically whiteout conditions. You know, you'd look out the window, you couldn't hardly even see outside. The massive storm leading to blizzard warnings in at least eight states. 30-mile-per-hour wind gusts in parts of Indiana and Ohio. Slippery roads and poor visibility across the heartland, blamed for the deaths of at least six people. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, icy roads (forced some frustrated drivers) to follow a plow truck, just to have a clear path. In Little Rock, freezing temperatures snapped power lines, leaving many in the dark. My friend is out of electricity and out of heat. So I come to get a propane exchange but then the lights went out before I could get checked out. Back in Indianapolis, spinout after spinout. Stranded motorists could not compete with the storm. A major operation is underway in the Arctic to move a town which is sitting on top of Europe's largest iron ore mine. Kiruna, in Sweden's far north is home to 18,000 people, a minority of them reindeer herders, who fear for their traditional way of life. Sunday worship in Kiruna's stunning wooden church, once voted the most loved building in Sweden. But soon, it will be pulled down, and reassembled, plank by plank, a few kilometers away.

The giant company eBay saying they can get a package to you within an hour after your order. So, ABC's Ron Claiborne took out the clock and put them to the test. It's the season to shop later, and to get what you buy faster than ever. Next day delivery? How about same day delivery? That's what some big retailers like Walmart and Amazon are doing this year.

This holiday season, eBay is touting that right now, for just a 5 delivery fee, you can get your purchase in 60 minutes or less.

But at 2:03 PM, bad news. Yeah, hello. They do not have any baseball shirts in stock. In the Nigerian city of Lagos, an explosion at a warehouse has sparked a massive fire. It's been reported that the blaze quickly spread to other buildings in a densely populated market district. Jon Gambrell, who's the chief correspondent for the Associated Press news agency in the city, described what he'd seen and what he'd heard. Earlier this morning at about 9 o'clock, I was still inside my own flat in Lagos when a massive explosion was heard. It rattled my windows a few miles away from where the blast happened. across much of this country tonight, a massive winter storm and already, the ripple effect for travel being felt coast to coast. The monster storm system stretching from Indiana to Maine, all the way down to North Carolina. More than a dozen states (under winter watches and warnings) this evening. And this is moving fast. Nearly a foot of snow in some states already. More than a foot of snow in forecast for Syracuse, New York, and in the heartland tonight, the threat of more twisters. Close to three dozen reported tornadoes on Christmas. This evening, they're bracing for more bad weather. Our extreme weather team is across the storm zone tonight. You can see Sam Champion there. He has the latest track in just a moment. But we're going to begin with ABC's Alex Perez in Indianapolis. Strong winds whipped around fast-falling snow in Indianapolis and made getting around by foot or car nearly impossible. David Mathis struggled just to keep up with the shoveling. You saw no snow and then within a couple of hours, what did you see? Yeah, just basically whiteout conditions. You know, you'd look out the window, you couldn't hardly even see outside. The massive storm leading to blizzard warnings in at least eight states. 30-mile-per-hour wind gusts in parts of Indiana and Ohio. Slippery roads and poor visibility across the heartland, blamed for the deaths of at least six people. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, icy roads (forced some frustrated drivers) to follow a plow truck, just to have a clear path. In Little Rock, freezing temperatures snapped power lines, leaving many in the dark. My friend is out of electricity and out of heat. So I come to get a propane exchange but then the lights went out before I could get checked out. Back in Indianapolis, spinout after spinout. Stranded motorists could not compete with the storm. A major operation is underway in the Arctic to move a town which is sitting on top of Europe's largest iron ore mine. Kiruna, in Sweden's far north is home to 18,000 people, a minority of them reindeer herders, who fear for their traditional way of life. Sunday worship in Kiruna's stunning wooden church, once voted the most loved building in Sweden. But soon, it will be pulled down, and reassembled, plank by plank, a few kilometers away.

With UPS, more than 300 every second. And there is a big, new race under way, companies promising to deliver your orders faster and faster. The giant company eBay saying they can get a package to you within an hour after your order. So, ABC's Ron Claiborne took out the clock and put them to the test. It's the season to shop later, and to get what you buy faster than ever. Next day delivery? How about same day delivery? That's what some big retailers like Walmart and Amazon are doing this year. ( We are in an arms race for speed today.) We want Santa on steroids. But the new extreme in fastest? Delivery in just one hour. This holiday season, eBay is touting that right now, for just a 5 delivery fee, you can get your purchase in 60 minutes or less. So far, they're testing it in two cities- - New York and San Francisco. For retailers, time really is money. Shipping later means being able to sell more goods. (Shipping faster breeds loyal customers.) It's not a practical benefit, it's an emotional benefit. Getting it fast is a present itself. Christmas is next week and I'm gonna order. But can they deliver? We decided to put it to the test. They're telling me I can get this at Macy's for 28. I place my order at 1:30 in the afternoon, for an LA Dodgers t-shirt.
